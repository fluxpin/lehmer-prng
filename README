An (exceedingly insecure!) implementation of the Lehmer PRNG. Optimized for
ease of mental computation.

For the provided values of P and M the operation is equivalent to
multiplying the ones digit of the input by six and adding the tens digit.
This is useful primarily as a particularly obscure sort of party trick.
